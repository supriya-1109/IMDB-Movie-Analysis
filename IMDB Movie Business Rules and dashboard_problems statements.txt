IMDB Movie Dataset – Business Rules (ETL Transformations)

These rules govern data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, validation, and analytics.

🧹 1. Data Cleaning Business Rules
BR-01: Duplicate Movie Handling

Rule: A movie is considered duplicate if title + release_year is repeated.

Action:

Keep the record with highest rating

If ratings are equal, keep the one with highest gross

BR-02: Missing Movie ID

Rule: movie_id must be unique and non-null.

Action:

Auto-generate a surrogate key during ETL if missing.

BR-03: Missing Rating

Rule: Ratings must be between 0 and 10.

Action:

Replace NULL ratings with genre-wise average rating.

If genre average is unavailable, use global average.

BR-04: Missing Budget

Rule: Budget cannot be negative or NULL for profitability analysis.

Action:

Replace NULL with median budget of the same genre.

If genre median unavailable → use overall median.

BR-05: Missing Gross Revenue

Rule: Gross revenue cannot be negative.

Action:

Replace NULL gross values with 0 (movie assumed not released / flopped).

BR-06: Missing Director / Actor

Rule: Director and lead actor are mandatory descriptive attributes.

Action:

Replace NULL values with 'Unknown'.

Dashboard Problem Statements(Matplotlib):

1. Identify Top 10 highest grossing movies by year.
2. Show rating distribution across genres.
3. Find Top 5 directors by average movie rating.
4. Analyze budget vs gross correlation.
5. Identify most profitable genre.
